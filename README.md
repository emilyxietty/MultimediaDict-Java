# MultimediaDict
This is a project that I created this past year for my Data Structures and Algorithm course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of ordered dictionaries. A binary search tree is created to implement an ordered dictionary that can easily perform user inputted commands.

Paramaters
---------
The user commands are as follows:
* first: print the smallest key in the dictionary.
* last: print the largest key in the dictionary.
* size: totals the number of keys in the dictionary.

Development Environment
---------
Eclipse IDE and IntelliJ IDE were used in the project.
